' Pumpkin Spice example 4
' RANDOM

' In the last example, we introduced the
' RANDOM(low, high) function for generating
' random numbers. Sometimes you want to choose
' an option randomly

' This program is an infinite loop
' It just keeps asking for a question
WHILE 1 = 1 DO

  ' Wait for the user to enter a question
  ' Keep asking if the input is blank
  QUESTION = ""
  WHILE QUESTION = ""
    PRINT "Ask the Magic 8-Ball a ""Yes or No"" question:"
    INPUT QUESTION
  END WHILE

  PRINT "The Magic 8-Ball says";
  SLEEP 400
  PRINT ".";
  SLEEP 400
  PRINT ".";
  SLEEP 400
  PRINT "."
